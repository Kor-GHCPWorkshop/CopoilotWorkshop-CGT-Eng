# Code Refactoring

Please analyze and refactor the selected C code. Focus on the following elements and suggest improvements:

## Analysis Items

1. **Eliminate Code Duplication**
   - Identify repeated code patterns and extract them into common functions
   - Especially check for duplication in database operations and string handling

2. **Function Separation and Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Split overly long functions (over 20 lines) into smaller, focused functions
   - Refactor so that each function performs only a single task

3. **Improve Data Access Layer**
   - Standardize SQL query preparation and execution code
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

4. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Implement a consistent error reporting mechanism
   - Ensure proper resource cleanup in error situations

5. **Optimize Memory Management**
   - Ensure deallocation of dynamically allocated memory
   - Add buffer size validation and boundary checks

6. **Enhance Readability**
   - Use clear variable/function names
   - Simplify complex conditional statements
   - Maintain consistent indentation and formatting

## Output Format

When presenting the refactored code, please follow this format:

1. **Summary of Changes**: Briefly explain what was changed and why
2. **Before/After Refactoring Code**: Compare the original code and the refactored code
3. **Improvement Effects**: Describe the benefits gained from refactoring (maintainability, performance, safety, etc.)

## Constraints

- Existing function signatures and APIs should be maintained as much as possible
- Refactoring should focus on improving internal structure, not changing functionality
- Comply with the C language standard (C99/C11), and avoid adding external library dependencies
- Follow the project's coding style guide

## Refactoring Example

```c
// Before Refactoring
void process_data(char *data, int size) {
    char buffer[100];
    strcpy(buffer, data);  // Buffer overflow risk
    
    // Data processing code...
    printf("Processed data: %s\n", buffer);
}

// After Refactoring
void process_data(char *data, int size) {
    if (data == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Data is NULL\n");
        return;
    }
    
    char buffer[100];
    if (size >= sizeof(buffer)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Data exceeds buffer size\n");
        return;
    }
    
    strncpy(buffer, data, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';  // Ensure NULL termination
    
    // Data processing code...
    printf("Processed data: %s\n", buffer);
}
```
